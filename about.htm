  Hanna is a calligrapher is based in the Seattle area. She has been doing calligraphy for over 2 years,
  and likes to call herself an artist. She is self taught, though she has taken a few hands on classes from other
  calligraphers. Her services can be used on everything that needs writing, from school projects to posters,
  and she has even designed protest posters. She has created cards, envelopes, and many pieces with her calligraphy,
  and created her business as a way to share her talent with the world. She writes in a
  style that is said to be traditional yet modern at the same time, and is inspired by copperplate calligraphy,
  and by calligraphy from other artists. Aside from calligraphy, she enjoys reading,
  and playing the clarinet in her school band. Contact her at
